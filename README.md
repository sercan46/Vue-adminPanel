# Admin Panel

I have a project that I developed using Vue.JS and Firebase. It is the system that is logged in using Firebase Authorization. After logging in, the About Us screen where the User (Company) information is entered, the Dashboard Screen where the reports are received, the Product List Screen where the products are listed, and the screen where the products are deleted and updated are in this list. There is another screen where the categories are listed and updated. Dark Theme/ Light Theme features are used. The Vue-webSite project is dynamically drawn with the data created from here.

## To start the project

npm install

react-native run-android || react-native run-ios
